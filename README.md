# üè• Doctor Clinic ‚Äì WhatsApp Appointment Automation

This project automates the complete **appointment management process for Doctor Clinic** using **n8n** ‚Äî from booking to payment, rescheduling, and reminders ‚Äî all via **WhatsApp messages**.

---

## üöÄ Overview

This automation enables patients to interact seamlessly with the clinic through WhatsApp.
When a user sends a message for the **first time**, they are greeted with a menu of options:

```
Hello, Welcome to Doctor Clinic!
Please choose an option:

1. New Booking
2. My Upcoming Bookings
3. Reschedule Booking
4. Cancel Booking
```

Each option launches a specific workflow that manages the corresponding process end-to-end using **Airtable** for data storage and **Stripe** for online payments.

---

## üß© Workflows Overview

There are **four main workflows**, each implemented and orchestrated in **n8n**.

---

### ü©∫ 1. New Booking Flow

#### **Steps:**

1. **Patient Lookup**

   * Retrieves the list of registered patients linked to the user‚Äôs WhatsApp number from **Airtable (Patients Table)**.
   * If no patient exists, the user is prompted to add a new one (Name, Age, Gender).
   * New `patient_id` is auto-generated sequentially (e.g., `patient_5` after `patient_4`).
   * Gender inputs are normalized to `Male` or `Female`.

2. **Date Selection**

   * Uses the **Date & Time Tool** to get the current system date.
   * Displays 7 available days (today + 6 days) for the user to choose from.

3. **Time Slot Selection**

   * Generates 1-hour slots between **10:00‚Äì18:00**.
   * Excludes:

     * Slots in `not_available` from the **Config Table** (queried using the Doctor Config tool).
     * Already booked slots from the **Appointments Table**.
     * Past time slots (if booking for the current day).
   * Displays available slots in sorted order for selection.

4. **Payment Options**
   ```
   How would you like to pay?
   1. Online (Stripe)
   2. Cash at Clinic
   ```

5. **Create Appointment Record**

   * Generates a new `appointment_id` sequentially (e.g., `appointment_5`).
   * Stores all booking data in the **Appointments Table**:

     * patient_id
     * whatsapp_number
     * date (ISO 8601 format)
     * time
     * payment_method (`Stripe` or `Cash`)
     * payment_status (`Not paid`)
     * status (`Confirmed`)

6. **Confirmation Message**

   ```
   Appointment booked!
   Appointment: appointment_5
   Patient: John Doe
   Date: 2025-10-03
   Time: 15:00
   Payment Method: Cash
   Payment Status: Not paid
   Status: Confirmed
   ```

2. **Date Selection**

     * Excludes already booked slots.
     * If rescheduling for *today*, only shows times after the current system time.

4. **Update Appointment**

   * Updates the existing appointment with the new date and time.

5. **Reschedule Confirmation**

   ```
   Your appointment has been rescheduled!
   Appointment: appointment_3
   Patient: John Doe
   New Date: 2025-10-02
   New Time: 16:00
   Status: Confirmed
   ```

### ‚ùå 4. Cancel Booking Flow

#### **Steps:**

   * Sends a confirmation message:

     ```

     ```
   * If payment was made via Stripe, the system automatically triggers a refund.
